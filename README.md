This is my learning repository 
It helps me find and organise learning resources so that I can streamline the way I work with course content.

#
Added eReader, which has two style modes - dark and white, for different time of the day you are reading.

#
Added Bootstrap-Nav-CV, playing with the navigation and grid classes on Bootstrap.

#
Added HomeWorkLandingPage - JS, separating structure from content by using HandleBarsJS.
